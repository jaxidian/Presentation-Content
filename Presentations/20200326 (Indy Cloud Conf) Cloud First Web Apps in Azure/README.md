# Cloud First Web Apps in Azure

*This talk will be given virtually at the 2020 Indy Cloud Conf conference, currently scheduled on March 26, 2020, at 11:15 am.*

## Summary

This presentation is intended to be a bit of an "Intro to Azure" conversation. The audience is expected to consist of two types of technologists:

1. Familiar with AWS but new to Azure.
2. New to Cloud development in general, including Azure.

Because of this, this talk will focus on some Intro to Cloud and Intro to Azure topics before getting into Cloud-First design practices and considerations when designing for the cloud.

## Presentation Resources

The only thing used for this presentation is a PowerPoint slide deck. This may evolve to show some services running in Azure via the Azure Portal, but that is out of scope for the talk for now.

### Demos

There are no code demos in this talk. Given the short duration of the presentation window, time did not allow for code demos without seriously cutting the amount of useful information being discussed.
