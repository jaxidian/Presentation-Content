# Cloud First Web Apps in Azure

*This talk will be given at the 2020 Indy Cloud Conf conference, currently scheduled at March 26, 2020 at 1:30pm. This date and time may still change.*

## Planning

For now, this readme is where I'm documenting the presentation outline. This will change as this content goes into the presentation and this readme will become an information page for the talk.

## Outline

1. Assuming audience is new to Azure, and potentially new to some cloud topics.
2. Don't want to spend too much time in "intro to cloud" topics because time is so limited. But can't avoid it with the audience. Also need to touch on "Why Cloud", unfortunately.
3. Talk about the IaaS/PaaS spectrum.
4. Show some Azure technologies and where they fit on the spectrum.
5. Present a workflow of "What services do I use in Azure?" with examples.
    - For instance, Lift & Shift of an IIS app -> App Services preferably, possible Cloud Services.
    - This might be somewhat similar to this page: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/serverless/
6. Walk a specific flow through the above workflow and let it lead into a demo
