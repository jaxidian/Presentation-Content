# Automated Machine Learning with ML.NET

*This talk is an abbreviated version of the AutoML talk I gave at IndySA on 20191121.*

## Planning

For now, this readme is where I'm documenting the presentation outline. This will change as this content goes into the presentation and this readme will become an information page for the talk.

## TODO

1. Copy talk resources over to this repo
2. Strip out "Intro to ML" portions of the talk
3. Streamline demos to just show ML.NET and not tpot or auto-sklearn. However, we want to talk about them just a bit.
4. ...
5. Profit
