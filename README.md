# Presentation-Content

This is the content from my public (and some private) speaking engagements.

## Contents

This repo is a new work-in-progress project of mine to accumulate, aggregate, organize, and thoroughly document presentation materials I've used over the years. I'm starting with my most current (and soon-to-be) talks and then filling in with older talks I've given in the past.

## Licensing

This monorepo has no master license. This means that if no license is presented with a particular item in this repo, then you are unauthorized to use it in any way and are not licensed to modify or redistribute it unless you have otherwise negotiated a license with me. I license myself, Shane Milton, to use the contents of this Repo and to use the contents of any changes that have gone or will go into this Repo.

If you see something that is improperly licensed (such as a required license file missing for a GPL particular component, for instance), please create an issue to let me know, and I'll get it corrected ASAP! I don't intend to omit or misidentify licenses. Still, accidental omissions may happen as I move some of these things into a public repo that I had otherwise never shared publicly. And if it is your work that I have improperly licensed, I offer my sincere apologies in advance. Please post an Issue, and I'll fix it ASAP!

### Future Licensing Intentions

I intend to consider opening licensing up on a case-by-case basis. I intend to comply with certain licenses for software and other items that I must comply with. I intend to be as open as possible. But until I have the time to thoroughly vet all items that will be going into this repo (which is a work-in-progress), it may contain items that I am simply unable to provide a license for (such as an employer logo in a slide deck). I intend to keep things locked down until I can open them up. I expect all of the text content in my presentation slides to be fully shared, but I also have to protect some resources where I have no authority to license them. So until I can do this, I'm just locking everything down so I do not accidentally violate any intellectual property. Which means, unless otherwise specified, you are not licensed to use anything in this repo.

## Other Stuff

This repo is a personal repo. Any expressions here are those of my own and not those of my employer.
