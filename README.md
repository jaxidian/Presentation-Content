# Licensing
This monorepo has no master license. This means the if no license is presented with a particular item in this repo, then you are unauthorized to use it in any way and are not licences to modify or redistribute it.

## Future Licensing Intentions
I intend to consider opening licensing up on a case-by-case basis. I intend to comply with certain licenses for software and other items that I must comply with. I intend to be as open as possible. But until I have the time to thoroughly vet all items that will be going into this repo (which is a work-in-progress) and may contain unlicensable items (such as corporate logos and such), my intention is to keep things locked down until I can open them up. I expect all of the text content in my presentation slides to be fully shared but have to protect some resources. So until I can do this, I'm just locking everything down so as to not accidentally violate any intellectual property. Which means, unless otherwise specified, you are not licensed to use anything in this repo.
